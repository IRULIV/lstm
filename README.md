# Predicting Queue Time with LSTM Classifier

The aim of this project is to build a model and forcast the expected queue time on the Epic cluster at Zenotech adopting supervised machine learning method. Given the fact that the training data provided to train the model is strongly time dependent (i.e. time series data), a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model has been adopted. LSTM are units of a recurrent neural network (RNN). A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. LSTM networks are well-suited to perfrom classification, regression and make predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
